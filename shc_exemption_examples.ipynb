    "# Vaccination Exemption Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to illustrate examples of how a Vaccination Exemption Card should be developed and implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is written in JavaScript and uses the [IJavascript kernel](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript) for Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of exemption frameworks and a region may select the one that fits their policy requirements:\n",
    "- If a jurisdiction decides to issue official exemptions to vaccinations, **we strongly recommend they issue a single, blanket exemption** for all individuals that require and qualify for one. This process is described in [Example A: General Exemption](Example_A). \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a jurisdiction **absolutely must** issue distinct types of exemptions (ie religious, medical, accessibility-related), then [Example B: Specific Exemptions](#Example_B) provides guidance on pursuing this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Exemptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generic:** An exemption that is issued to any patient that requires one, regardless of the reason or intent for obtaining an exemption.\n",
    "- **Medical:** An exemption that is issued to a patient with a medical reason that prevents them from receiving a vaccination. The exact medical reason SHALL NOT be documented in the SHC Exemption to protect patient privacy.\n",
    "- **Religious:** An exemption that is issued to a patient with sincerely held religious beliefs that prevent them from receiving a vaccination. The exact religion SHALL NOT be documented in the SHC Exemption to protect patient privacy.\n",
    "- **Vaccine-Not-Available:** An exemption that is issued to a patient who is unable to access vaccination services, most likely due to accessibility or availability challenges."

    "\n",
    "Jurisdication A's Health Department does not need to distinguish between types of exemptions, they only need to know that an individual is exempt and they issue a singular, blanket exemption for individuals that require one. The below example is for an individual, Sue D. Anyperson, that has received an exemption. In vaccineCode.coding, the Jurisdiction A would fill in their Health Department's website that indicates what the exemption means and the vaccineCode.code field indicates that Jane received a vaccination-exemption."
